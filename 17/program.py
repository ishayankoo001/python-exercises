def es17(ls, k):
    '''Design  function es17(ls,k) that receives as input
    - a list ls of words
    - an integer k

    and deletes from ls all the words that contain at least k equal
    characters. No distinction has to be made between uppercase and
    lowercase. The function also returns the number of deleted words.
    
    For example,
    - if ls=[ 'ananas', 'pera', 'banana', 'melone', 'kiwi','albicocca']
    - and k=3
    the function returns 3 and the list becomes ['pera', 'melone', 'kiwi']

    - if ls=[ 'Angelo', 'Andrea', 'Osvaldo', 'Anna', 'Monica', 'Adele'] and k=2
    the function returns 4 and the list becomes ['Angelo', 'Monica']
