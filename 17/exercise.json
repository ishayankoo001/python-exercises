No distinction has to be made between uppercase and\n    lowercase. The function also returns the number of deleted words.\n    \n    For example,\n    - if ls=[ 'ananas', 'pera', 'banana', 'melone', 'kiwi','albicocca']\n    - and k=3\n    the function returns 3 and the list becomes ['pera', 'melone', 'kiwi']\n\n    - if ls=[ 'Angelo', 'Andrea', 'Osvaldo', 'Anna', 'Monica', 'Adele'] and k=2\n    the function returns 4 and the list becomes ['Angelo', 'Monica']\n\n",
