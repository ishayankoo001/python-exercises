def ex6():
   '''Design a function ex6(string_set) such that:
   - it is recursive or uses recursive function(s)/methods(s)









   - it receives a set of strings 'string_set' as argument
   - it exploits the strings in 'string_set' to reconstruct a binary
     tree in which the values of the nodes are single characters
   - it returns the reconstructed binary tree as a tree of nodes of
     type BinaryTree, defined in the attached tree.py library.
   Each string of 'string_set' represents a sequence of the values of
   the nodes traversed following the path from a leaf to the root of a
   binary tree. The tree is such that:
   - the value of each node is one single character
   - each internal node is locally ordered from left to right, namely:
     - each left child has a value smaller than that of the father
     - each right child has a value greater than that of the father

   Example: if the tree to reconstruct is

                     i     
                     |
             |-----------------|               
             h                 m 
             |                 |   
         |--------|        |------|   
         c        j        k      p
         |        |               |
      |-----|  |-----|         |-----|
      a     f  g     k         m     q    

   The set of strings is:
      { 'achi', 'qpmi', 'gjhi', 'fchi', 'mpmi', 'kmi', 'kjhi' }
