def es47(lista):
    '''design the function es47(string_list) which:

    - takes as an input a list of strings, and
    - returns a list of strings.

    The function returns a list obtained from the input list after
    deleting duplicates, and in which the strings have been ordered by
    increasing length and, in case of equal length, by descending
    alphabetical order.

    At the end of the function the list received as input MUST NOT be
    modified.

    For example:
    - for string_list=[ 'uuu','ccc','a','aa','d','z','zzz','uuu','z','z','uuu']

    the function has to  return the list
    - ['z','d','a','aa','zzz','uuu','ccc']
    while the input list will not be modified.
