def es78(word):
    '''Define the recursive function (or a function that uses your own
    recursive function) es78(word), that takes as input a string of
    characters and returns the list of different \"growing subwords\"
    of the given word. The subwords must appear in the list in
    alphabetical order.  Remember that a subword is what you get from
    a word by removing 0 or more characters (in front, at the end or
    in the middle of the word).  In addition, a subword is said to
    grow if the characters that make it up read from left to right are
    sorted in alphabetical order.
    
    For example the list returned by es78('zanzara') will be
    ['a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'aar', 'an', 'anr', 'anz', 'ar', 'az', 'n', 'nr', 'nz', 'r', 'z', 'zz']
