def es45(word1, word2):
    '''design the function es45(word1,word2) which
    - takes as an input two character strings word1 and word2, and

    - returns the list of substrings are in common to both strings.

    The list of common substrings must be ordered in alphabetical
    order and must not contain duplicates.

    Remember that a substring is what you get from a string deleting 0
    or more characters at the beginning and 0 or more characters at
    the end.

    For example:
    - if word1='aabbccdd' and word2='acccdzza'
    the function returns the list ['a', 'c', 'cc', 'ccd', 'cd', 'd']
