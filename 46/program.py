def es46(parola):
    '''Design and implement the function es13(word) that uses at least
    one recursive function and:
    - takes a character string as input and, among all the substrings,
    returns the one of maximum length that is also palindrome.  In
    case there are more palindromes with maximum length, the first in
    alphabetical order is returned.

    Remember that: a substring is what you get from a string by
    deleting 0 or more characters at the beginning and 0 or more
    characters at the end; a string is said palindrome if it can be
    read indifferently from left to right or vice versa.

    For example:
    - if word='zzzcdcaaabvv' the function will return the palindrome
    string 'aaa'
    - if word='adbbabbcbbaad' the function will return
    the palindrome string 'abbcbba'
