def ex39(n, jsonFile):
    '''Given an integer n, a spiral matrix of order n is a matrix of
    dimensions n x n which shows the numbers from 1 to n**2, following
    a clockwise spiral.  For example the spiral matrix of order 4 is
    
     1 2 3 4 
    12 13 14 5
    11 16 15 6
    10 9 8 7 
    
    Design a function ex39(n, jsonFile) such that
    - it takes as argument an int 'n' and the path of a json file 'jsonFile'
    - it writes in json format in the file 'jsonFile' the list of
      lists representing the spiral matrix of order n
    - it returns the sum of the values in the columns with the even
      indexes of the matrix.

    Example: for n=4 the jsonFile will contain
     [[1, 2, 3, 4],[12, 13, 14, 5],[11, 16, 15, 6], [10, 9, 8, 7]]
     and the value returned will be 74.
