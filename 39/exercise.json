    "text": "Given an integer n, a spiral matrix of order n is a matrix of\n    dimensions n x n which shows the numbers from 1 to n**2, following\n    a clockwise spiral.  For example the spiral matrix of order 4 is\n    \n     1 2 3 4 \n    12 13 14 5\n    11 16 15 6\n    10 9 8 7 \n    \n    Design a function ex39(n, jsonFile) such that\n    - it takes as argument an int 'n' and the path of a json file 'jsonFile'\n    - it writes in json format in the file 'jsonFile' the list of\n      lists representing the spiral matrix of order n\n    - it returns the sum of the values in the columns with the even\n      indexes of the matrix.\n\n    Example: for n=4 the jsonFile will contain\n     [[1, 2, 3, 4],[12, 13, 14, 5],[11, 16, 15, 6], [10, 9, 8, 7]]\n     and the value returned will be 74.",
