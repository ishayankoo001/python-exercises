def es44(a, b):
    '''Write the function es44(a,b) which

    - gets as an input two integers a and b and

    - returns the set of the first a integers that have exactly b dividers.

    For example:

    - if a=20 and b=2 the function returns the set of the
    first 20 prime numbers (because only prime numbers have exactly 2
    divisors), that is: {2, 3, 67, 5, 37, 7, 71, 41, 11, 43, 13, 47,
    17, 19, 61, 53, 23, 59, 29, 31}

    - if a=10 and b=4 the function returns
    the set {6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26, 27, 33}
